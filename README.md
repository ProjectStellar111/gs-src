# Forge
Fortnite gameserver for 10.40.

# By me?
**I fixed building the dll**
* Currently trying to fix pickaxes - Not looking too good
* Patched mechs from spawning in - When they hit the ground they break auto.
* Added a restart servers button - Kinda Works
* Everything else in main features was done by milxnor and his crew.

**Please keep in mind I'm not that good at C++ and only know a little bit**

# Broken atm
* The help or need ammo emojis - Fixing it using code from [here](https://github.com/Milxnor/Project-Reboot-3.0)
* Pickaxes

Main features:

- proper looting
- chest stars
- directional fix + weakspot fix
- vehicles
- semi working creative (framework.h)
- some little gameplay features
- pretty accurate harvesting rate
- run over ammo & mats
- pickup delay
- repairing

# New
- Restart button - Kinda Works!

## This comes with the cosmetics from locker!
- It was never really mentioned really didn't find out until I was browsing the code and found Globals::MCP - Found out it was cosmetics from locker so that's cool.

# Coming Soon to ForgeFN by me?
- I'm going to be making the GUI look wayyy better also add some more options like to a player you can change there skin if it MCP = true instead of false!
