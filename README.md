# Fortnite GS
* Forge is a 10.40 open-sourced Game Server used for Educational Purposes Only.
* Doesn't mean you SKID it and host for yourself without giving credits.

# By me?
* Updated GUI
* Pickaxes (Nvm Milxnor did it) I haven't tested..
* Auto Start fixed completely (i lied) - Adding to where if there isn't a player in the game then the count down doesn't start till then.

**All of this Game Server was completely done by Milxnor and whoever else worked on it**

# ERRORS
* You're own traps kill you (so i took them out for the time-being) 
* Still boredd and bored
* Bored
* Lategame (i forgot)

# I'M STUPID
* if you get an error and it says detours just uninstall it and reinstall it
* if you don't know how to do it then search it up ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
